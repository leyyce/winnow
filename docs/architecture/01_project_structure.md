# 01 — Project Structure

> **Winnow** — QA framework for user submitted data in citizen science projects

This document defines the target directory layout for the FastAPI microservice. The structure follows **Clean Architecture** principles: dependencies point inward, and every layer has a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Terminology convention:** In Winnow, *"Validation"* refers exclusively to **Stage 1** — structural and technical checks enforced by Pydantic schemas (types, ranges, required fields). *"Scoring"* refers to **Stage 2** (Confidence Score calculation). *"Trust Evaluation & Advisory"* refers to **Stage 4** — using the client-provided trust level as a scoring input (Tₙ) and computing a `trust_adjustment` recommendation based on ground-truth finalization signals. *"Governance"* refers to Winnow's role as the **authoritative engine** for the validation workflow: it owns the submission lifecycle state, determines review requirements, and orchestrates which submissions are eligible for review by whom. The directory layout below reflects this separation.

### Domain Ownership Principle

| Concern | Owner | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain Data** (trees, species, measurements, photos) | Laravel (client) | The client project owns its entities and business objects. |
| **Validation Process State** (submission status, review requirements, task eligibility) | **Winnow** | Winnow is the single source of truth for the QA workflow. The client renders whatever Winnow permits. |
| **User Identity & Trust Level** | Laravel (client) | The client owns users and their trust. Winnow receives trust on the wire and returns advisory deltas. |
| **Scoring Results & Audit Trail** | **Winnow** | Immutable submission snapshots, scores, and finalization history. |

## Stage Mapping to Directories

| Stage | Concern | Where in the codebase |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1 — Validation** | Schema correctness, types, required fields, range bounds, completeness | `app/schemas/` — especially `app/schemas/projects/*.py` (Pydantic `Field` constraints) |
| **Stage 2 — Scoring** | Confidence Score factors: Hₙ, Aₙ, Pₙ, Kₙ | `app/scoring/projects/` (domain-specific `ScoringRule` implementations) |
| **Stage 4 — Trust Evaluation & Advisory** | Dual role: (a) use client-provided `trust_level` as scoring input Tₙ, (b) compute `trust_adjustment` recommendation after ground-truth finalization | `app/scoring/common/trust_level.py` (Tₙ factor), `app/scoring/common/trust_advisor.py` (delta computation) |
| **Governance** | Determine review requirements ("Target State"), filter eligible tasks per reviewer trust level, own the validation workflow lifecycle | `app/governance/` (policies), `app/services/governance_service.py` (orchestration) |

> **Stage 1 is the gatekeeper.** If the payload fails Pydantic validation, the request is rejected with a `422` error *before* any scoring rule is invoked. This keeps scoring rules clean — they can safely assume that the data they receive has already passed all structural checks.

### Finalization & Trust Advisory Flow

The scoring pipeline (Stages 1 → 2 → 4-input) runs synchronously on submission. However, **the Trust Advisor's recommendation** (Stage 4 output) is only computed after the client sends a **ground-truth finalization signal** — i.e., when a human expert or the community confirms the final verdict (approved / rejected).

| Phase | Trigger | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Initial scoring** | `POST /api/v1/submissions` | Confidence Score, `required_validations` (Target State), preliminary status (`pending_finalization`) |
| **Task query** | `GET /api/v1/tasks/available?user_trust=X` | Submissions eligible for review by a user with the given trust level |
| **Finalization** | `PATCH /api/v1/submissions/{id}/final-status` | Ground-truth status persisted; Trust Advisor computes `trust_adjustment` delta |

## Layer Responsibilities

### `app/api/` — Presentation Layer

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Accepts HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. |
| **Contains** | Route handlers, dependency injection (`Depends`), request/response mapping. |
| **Rule** | No business logic here. Handlers call into `services/` and return `schemas/` models. |

### `app/schemas/` — API Contracts & Stage 1 Validation (Pydantic V2)

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Define the shape of data that crosses the API boundary **and** enforce Stage 1 validation. |
| **Contains** | Pydantic `BaseModel` classes. Strictly **no** SQLAlchemy imports. |
| **Key file** | `envelope.py` — implements the **Envelope Pattern** (see `03_api_contracts.md`). |
| **`projects/` sub-folder** | Each project registers its own payload schema here. These schemas enforce **all Stage 1 checks**: required fields (completeness), type correctness, range constraints (e.g., `height: float = Field(gt=0, le=150)`), and structural rules (e.g., `photos: list[TreePhoto] = Field(min_length=2)`). |

### `app/models/` — Persistence Layer (SQLAlchemy 2.0)

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Map Python objects to PostgreSQL tables. |
| **Contains** | SQLAlchemy `Mapped` classes. Strictly **no** Pydantic imports. |
| **Rule** | Models are always separated from schemas to avoid tight coupling between API shape and DB schema. |

### `app/services/` — Application / Use-Case Layer

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Orchestrate domain operations: receive a submission, run Stage 1 validation via the registry's Pydantic schema, trigger the Stage 2 + Stage 4 scoring pipeline, determine governance requirements, persist results, process finalization signals, and serve task queries. |
| **Contains** | Stateless service functions or thin classes that coordinate `scoring/`, `governance/` rules and `models/` persistence. |
| **Key files** | `scoring_service.py` — resolves the project config from the registry, validates the raw payload against the project-specific Pydantic schema (Stage 1), then passes the validated object to the `ScoringPipeline` (Stage 2 + Stage 4 input). After scoring, invokes the governance policy to compute `required_validations`. On finalization, delegates to the Trust Advisor to compute the `trust_adjustment` delta (Stage 4 output). `governance_service.py` — queries eligible tasks for a given trust level using the project's governance policy. |
| **Rule** | May depend on `scoring/`, `governance/`, `models/`, `schemas/`; must **not** depend on `api/`. |

### `app/registry/` — Registry Domain (Project Composer)

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | The single top-level domain that wires together schemas, scoring rules, and governance policies for each registered project. Decoupled from all three sub-domains it composes. |
| **Contains** | `ProjectRegistryEntry` dataclass, `_Registry` singleton, `ProjectBuilder` ABC, and one concrete `ProjectBuilder` per project under `projects/`. |
| **Key abstraction** | `ProjectBuilder` (Open/Closed): adding a new project means creating a new subclass in `registry/projects/` and registering it in `bootstrap.py` — no existing code changes. |
| **Rule** | No HTTP, no DB imports. The registry is populated at startup by `bootstrap.py` and consumed by services via dependency injection. |

### `app/bootstrap.py` — Startup Bootstrap

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Initializes the registry singleton and loads all active `ProjectBuilder` instances at application startup. |
| **Usage** | Called once from the FastAPI `lifespan` handler in `main.py`. Auto-executes on import so tests work without an explicit call. |
| **Rule** | Adding a new project = import its `ProjectBuilder` here and call `registry.load(MyProjectBuilder())`. |

### `app/scoring/` — Domain Layer (Scoring Core)

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Houses all **scoring rules** (the "strategies") and the pipeline that runs them. This is the Confidence Score engine. |
| **Contains** | An abstract `ScoringRule` base, the `ScoringPipeline`, and concrete rule implementations. The registry has been extracted to `app/registry/`. |
| **Sub-folders** | `common/` for reusable scoring factors (e.g., `trust_level.py` for Tₙ input, `trust_advisor.py` for Stage 4 advisory output), `projects/<name>/` for domain-specific scoring rules. |
| **Rule** | Pure logic — no HTTP, no DB imports. Rules receive **validated** data (Pydantic model instances that already passed Stage 1) and return score components. |
| **Not here** | Completeness checks, range checks, type validation — these belong in `app/schemas/projects/` as Pydantic `Field` constraints (Stage 1). Governance decisions belong in `app/governance/`. |

### `app/governance/` — Domain Layer (Governance Authority)

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Determines the **review requirements** ("Target State") for each scored submission and controls **task eligibility** — which submissions a reviewer of a given trust level may validate. Winnow is the single source of truth for the validation workflow. |
| **Contains** | An abstract `GovernancePolicy` base and project-specific policy implementations that encode rules like "score > 90% → needs 1 peer review; score < 50% → needs expert review". |
| **Key output** | A `RequiredValidations` object (min_validators, required_min_trust, required_role) that is included in the POST /submissions response and used by the task query endpoint. |
| **Rule** | Pure logic — no HTTP, no DB imports. Receives a `ScoringResult` and project config, returns governance metadata. |
| **Design intent** | By centralising "who is allowed to validate what" logic in Winnow, client projects (Laravel) are relieved from re-implementing this complex workflow. They act as **Task Clients** — rendering whatever Winnow permits. |

### `app/db/` — Database Infrastructure

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Provide async SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and Alembic migration environment. |
| **Contains** | `session.py` (engine + `async_sessionmaker`), Alembic config. |
| **Rule** | Single source of truth for connection management. All other layers obtain sessions via FastAPI `Depends`. |

### `app/core/` — Configuration & Cross-Cutting Concerns

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Centralised application settings, logging setup, and any shared utilities. |
| **Contains** | `config.py` using `pydantic-settings` to read environment variables with validation. |

### `app/tests/` — Test Suite

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Automated tests mirroring the source tree. |
| **Contains** | Pytest fixtures (`conftest.py`), unit tests for scoring rules and services, integration tests for API endpoints. |
| **Rule** | Uses an isolated test database (or SQLite in-memory for fast unit tests). |

## Dependency Flow

The following diagram shows the allowed import direction between layers. Arrows mean "depends on".

```mermaid
graph TD
    API["api/ (Presentation)"]
    SCHEMAS["schemas/ (Pydantic — Stage 1 Validation)"]
    SERVICES["services/ (Use Cases)"]
    SCORING["scoring/ (Domain — Stage 2 + Stage 4 Trust Evaluation & Advisory)"]
    GOVERNANCE["governance/ (Domain — Workflow Authority)"]
    MODELS["models/ (SQLAlchemy)"]
    DB["db/ (Infrastructure)"]
    CORE["core/ (Config)"]

    API --> SCHEMAS

    SERVICES --> GOVERNANCE
    SERVICES --> MODELS
    SERVICES --> SCHEMAS
    MODELS --> DB
    API --> CORE
    SERVICES --> CORE
    DB --> CORE
```

> **Key constraint:** `scoring/` and `governance/` have **zero** dependencies on `models/`, `db/`, or `api/`. This keeps the scoring engine and governance logic portable and testable in isolation. The `governance/` layer depends on scoring outputs (the Confidence Score) but not on scoring internals.
